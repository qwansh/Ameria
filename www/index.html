        <h1 class="title">CHAIRMAN’S LETTER</h1>

        <p>Dear Customers, Shareholders and Partners,</p>
        <br>

        <p>We have concluded 2014 with unprecedented achievements as an absolute leader in the market by key
            financial indicators - profit, total assets, loans to customers, total liabilities and liabilities to
            customers. Through our consistent focus on customer service, innovations and increase of shareholder
            value we maintained a resilient and prudent balance sheet on the background of our annual growth
            prevailing market growth rates several times. Net AMD profit grew by 18%, while the market net profit
            reduced by 41.3%. Return on average equity to the Bank’s shareholders was strong likewise, at 17.8%,
            while the market’s was 5.6%. In 2014, Ameriabank and FMO (The Netherlands Development Finance Company)
            for the first time since the formation of the Armenian banking system signed a USD 20 mln convertible
            subordinated debt facility agreement. We expect the conversion into equity to take place in the first
            half of 2015. Overall, in 2014 Ameriabank demonstrated a particularly robust and unmatched performance
            against local macroeconomic and regulatory changes at the end of the year. </p>

        <p>From a macroeconomic perspective, Armenia delivered relatively strong GDP growth of 3.4% in 2014 compared
            with that of the previous year. Such growth demonstrated the resilience of the Armenian economy in the
            light of macroeconomic and currency devaluation pressures in Armenia and many of Armenia’s trading
            partner countries. Armenian Dram depreciated up to 17% against the US dollar during 2014, considerably
            affecting customer behaviour. Given this, we have adjusted our risk management metrics and controls to
            reflect the revised macroeconomic outlook. It is noteworthy that the Bank’s asset quality has not
            deteriorated: Ameriabank is positioned among top 5 Banks with lowest non-performing loans ratio, while
            featuring the biggest loan portfolio in the market. </p>

        <p>In December 2014, in line with macroeconomic and currency devaluation pressures the Central Bank of
            Armenia raised the minimum amount of total capital to AMD 30 bln from the current AMD 5 bln from January
            1, 2017. This was yet another toughening of a key requirement aimed at ensuring the stability,
            efficiency and transparency in a liberal, but strictly regulated Armenian banking environment.
            Ameriabank is one of five Banks among 21 operating Banks in the market that already today complies with
            the requirement of AMD 30 bln. We see this as a potentially attractive opportunity for our non-organic
            growth. I would also like to highlight our accomplishments with respect to corporate governance.
            Ameriabank has traditionally had high standards of corporate governance. We believe that effective
            succession planning mitigates the risks and increases efficiency of management. Hence, in 2014 I
            succeeded the former Chairman Mr. Ruben Vardanyan who remains as Board Member enhancing the proficiency
            of Board performance by his invaluable experience, knowledge and leadership. We continued to augment our
            risk governance structure. In 2014, we actively worked on a new development phase for the
            Bank’s Corporate Governance by drafting charters for Board Committees such as Audit, Risk, Remuneration
            and Nomination, as well as Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, all coming into force in 2015. The
            latter is an important milestone toward further enhancing our team-centric and customer-oriented
            corporate culture. We continued our robust investments in development of our People, as well as in
            identification of the best talents in the market.</p>

        <p>Looking ahead, we will continue to focus on our competitive strengths to further enhance our leading
            positions across all segments and continue delivering strong financial performance in 2015 and beyond. I
            believe that our efforts aimed at consistent excellence will help us to sustain our leadership position
            in the market and to grow further both organically and non-organically despite expected turbulent
            macroeconomic climate.</p>

        <p>Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to all Clients, Partners, Shareholders, my fellow Board
            members, the Bank’s outstanding Management team and to our Team, who have jointly supported Ameriabank
            on its growth path to our current position of the market leadership.</p>

        <h1 class="title">CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S<br>REVIEW</h1>

        <p>Our 2014 results and market positions clearly demonstrate the benefits of the resilient business model
            and strategy we have adopted in Ameriabank for the past 7 years. Thanks to consistent – albeit agile –
            response to the drastic market developments we were able to capture the momentum and report a year-end
            profit up by 18%, being first in the market, and return on our shareholders’ average equity up to 17.8%.
            Our performance reflected trust of our partners and customers, strength of our balance sheet, viability
            of cost control mechanisms, and steady growth of profitability despite the sluggish development of the
            overall finance industry.</p>

        <p>I would like to present 2014 by highlighting some of the key drivers of our continuous growth and
            success.</p>

        <h1 class="greenTitle">AMBITION TO EXCEL MARKET BENCHMARKS</h1>

        <p>We have greatly enjoyed our leadership being the first in the market by profit, assets, loan portfolio,
            liabilities and customers’ deposits. Being the market leader is flattering but at the same time obliging
            to serve as the most representative benchmark in the market of 20 Banks that are to follow you. We are
            determined to maintain our market leadership, which is built on our strong Retail Banking and Corporate
            Banking businesses, comprising the backbone of the Bank.</p>

        <p>We remained committed to our strategic goal of becoming a truly Universal Bank with diversified loan
            portfolio and revenue stream. As a result of numerous campaigns and new products/solutions we
            experienced 73.2% annual growth in SME lending and 37.7% annual growth in retail lending. Despite
            featuring the biggest loan portfolio in the market we are among the top five Banks with lowest NPL ratio
            at 3.1%, while the market average in 2014 was 7.86%. We were also focused on increasing efficiency and
            shareholder return by reaching return on average equity to around 17.8% in line with our annual
            strategic targets. Another aspect of our daily focus was optimizing cost control and cost to income
            ratio, which is much below the banking sector’s ratio at 49.4%.</p>

        <p>Our total attracted funds from International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and non-resident partner banks
            have reached USD 373 mln (including TFP) and indicate a long-term solid partnership and trust between
            our Bank and IFIs. It is worth mentioning that this is an unprecedented amount issued to a single bank
            operating in Armenia. In 2014, we have signed several notable loan facility agreements including one
            with the EBRD for USD 10 mln, BSTDB for USD 10 mln and FMO USD 20 mln convertible subordinated debt.</p>

        <p>In 2014, the Bank secured annual AMD net growth rates of 26.9% by assets, 62.5% by loans (including
            leasing and factoring), 29.3% by liabilities and 22.8% by clients’ deposits, surpassing the market
            annual growth rates which were 16.1% for assets, 20.4% for loans, 18% for liabilities and 4.45% for
            clients’ deposits.</p>

        <h1 class="greenTitle">ACCELERATION THROUGH INNOVATION</h1>

        <p>At Ameriabank we always focus on using the most innovative and cutting-edge technologies for our banking
            solutions, and are permanently committed to sustaining high standards of service. As a result of our
            commitment TÜV Rheinland Germany has consistently reissued ISO 9001:2008 quality management certificate
            to Ameriabank since 2009. In 2014 we have launched 24/7 fully operating contact center, as well as
            enhanced accessibility for Ameria Online Banking users, by developing mobile banking. We offer globally
            competitive trading and brokerage platforms to our clients. In March of 2014, we officially launched our
            Arshakunyats Branch in newly opened Yerevan Mall that welcomed 1st cash-in ATM machine providing fast
            self-service for retail clients.</p>

        <h1 class="greenTitle">ASSESSMENT AS A CHECKPOINT</h1>

        <p>As a truly client-oriented Bank, we carefully follow our NPS score improvement year over year and we are
            happy that our customers’ overall satisfaction from the Bank’s service quality and performance has been
            constantly increasing trend. We also continue our financial and professional investments into
            enhancement of our sophisticated CRM system. As a result of our continuous efforts aimed at improving
            and excelling our service quality and market position, Ameriabank is 1st by brand awareness among
            Armenian companies, according to annual monitoring surveys held by Ameria Management Advisory team.</p>

        <p>Ameriabank was named The Best Bank of the Year 2014 in Armenia by Euromoney Awards for Excellence for the
            3rd time, Best Bank and Best Trade Finance Bank by Global Finance Magazine for the 4th time and also
            obtained “Deal of the Year” award by the EBRD.</p>

        <h1 class="greenTitle">ABILITY TO UNITE, CHALLENGE AND ACCOMPLISH</h1>

        <p>At Ameriabank we have a vigorous belief in that the cornerstone of our success is our Team of
            professional and loyal enthusiasts. Our axis is our people who enjoy and are proud of being part of our
            Dream Team. Therefore, we consistently invest in developing our employees through various educational
            and mentoring programmes. We have our own full-scale operational training center. We have also initiated
            an internship programme for graduates, called “Generation A”. It identifies recruits and develops bright
            talents among a huge pool of young applicants. Thus we have created corporate culture that encourages
            growth and enthusiasm. It provides unprecedented benefits to its employees, especially to those with
            sound and consistent track-record during semi-annual evaluation cycles.</p>

        <p>Looking back, I am proud of how much has been achieved. Entrepreneurial spirit is at the heart of
            Ameriabank’s culture and is one of our strongest assets. It has resulted in the creation of a very
            strong brand that will be very difficult to match and even harder to displace. Such success in turn has
            created a new important task for us. We should diversify our loan portfolios and revenue streams, as
            well as enlarge operations through local and regional acquisitions.</p>

        <h1 class="greenTitle">APPRECIATION AND LOOKING FORWARD</h1>

        <p>We are looking forward to a busy and exciting year ahead of us. The key strategic initiatives that we
            undertook a few years ago are gaining momentum. While we made considerable progress this past year, I
            believe we have much more work ahead of us to realise the great potential of Ameriabank. We are
            confident in our competitive position and remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders,
            lenders, customers and employees.</p>

        <p>I am much honoured to extend my word of appreciation to our team consisting of true professionals and
            bright individuals. Yet again, let me also deliver my gratitude to all our clients, partners, suppliers
            and all other stakeholders for their trust and loyalty leading to our consistent improvement and
            absolute leadership in the market. We are thankful for the continuing support, encouragement and
            goodwill of all our shareholders and the Board.</p>

            Since 2007 Ameria Group of companies has been providing wide range of advisory and financial services both
            in local and
            international markets. The Group has proven its leadership and excellence in the market through its
            financial performance
            figures, customised approaches, full-fledge solutions, diversity of client base and wide list of high
            profile clients.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ameria Group has been on the market for 17 years now. Starting from 1998, it has been uniting young,
            dedicated and promising
            experts of the local market as one of the first professional advisory firms in Armenia. 1999 and 2007 Ameria
            diversified its
            advisory services complimenting those with legal advice, tax & assurance, and asset management. In 2007,
            Ameria, together
            with Ameria Group (CY) Limited (previously TDA Holdings Limited) started the most aggressive expansion in
            the Armenian
            emerging financial sector. As a result of this partnership, in 2007 Ameria Group (CY) Limited acquired the
            majority share in the
            capital of Armimpexbank that was renamed and rebranded into Ameriabank a year later. With this change of
            stakeholders the
            Bank stepped into a new age of development with new strategy and management principles. At present, Ameria
            Group is one of
            the few if not only organizations in the country providing such a wide range of advisory and financial
            solutions in such key areas

                Erivan Branch of Tiflis Trade Bank was built on Ter-Ghukasov St. In 1916 Tiflis Trade Bank was renamed
                into Caucasus Bank.
                The archived documents state that most of the monetary resources transferred to Armenia came through the
                Erivan Branch of
                Caucasus Bank.

            <p>
                In 2014 Ameria Group organised the 5th traditional New Year and Christmas charity auction, to fundraise
                for the treatment of children with life-threatening diseases. The auction was held under the slogan
                “Sport for Life” featuring autographed souvenirs by world-known sportsmen, also those of Armenian
                origin. Many of them teamed up and donated memorabilia with a special autograph for this auction. The
                united commitment of world-known sportsmen to contribute to this cause was yet another expression of our
                corporate values, i.e. team spirit and integrity.
                As a result, a total pool of more than AMD 62 mln was channeled to medical treatment of kids with
                life-threatening diseases (Ref.: Ameria Group raised AMD 31 mln in 2013, AMD 35 mln in 2012, AMD 19 mln
                in 2011 and AMD 21 mln in 2010. Each year all proceeds were doubled by Ameria Group). The auction
                proceeds went to kids with idiopathic arthritis and onco-haemotological diseases, who are beneficiaries
                of “Let’s Help the Armenian Children”, “Gift of Life” and “Children without Pain” foundations. In 2014,
                for the first time the traditional auction was supplemented by an online auction, involving not only
                Ameria Group’s partners and clients but also the Armenian public.
            </p>

            <p>
                So far, thanks to direct contributions and donations from Ameria Group, its partners, clients and staff,
                AMD 364 mln has been directed for children’s treatment, saving more than 135 lives.

        <p>Macroeconomic situation, in which the banking system of Armenia evolved in 2014, was characterised by
            continuous post-crisis recovery developments in first half of the year and pre-crisis developments in the
            second half due to worsening of the economic situation in Russia.</p>

        <p>It is worthwhile to mention that after five years of economic growth starting from 2009 decline, 2014 GDP in
            real terms surpassed the pre-recession level GDP by 5.4%. Although the real GDP finally achieved the 2008
            level, the nominal USD-denominated GDP still lags behind the pre-recession level by 6.7%, mainly due to
            downward pressure of USD on AMD with 55% over the recent 6 years, including over 15% depreciation of AMD
            against USD during last 2 months of 2014.</p>

        <p>The financial and insurance services sector has been the most rapidly growing sector in GDP over the past 4
            years. Anyway after two-digit average growth in 2010-2013, the sector’s growth was slowed in 2014 to 4.8%.
            This slowdown is mainly explained by drop of oil prices in 2014 and slowdown of Russia’s economy. As a
            result, remittances inflow to Armenia from Russia drastically decreased. Another reason for slowdown of
            finance and insurance sectors was the instability of Armenian dram, which had lost 15% against USD in the
            last two months of 2014.</p>

        <p>Over the past few years, Armenia has taken steps towards improving the investment and business climate in the
            country. As a result, in 2014, Armenia improved its position in “Doing Business 2015” report by the World
            Bank Group and positioned itself on the 45th position, up by 4 positions compared with 2014 ranking.</p>

            pursued by the Central Bank was ensuring long-term sustainability of the banking system and developing
            financial intermediation. Currently only five commercial banks in Armenia have a capital above AMD 30 bln.
            As a result, the years 2015 and 2016 are likely to witness new equity investments, appearance of new
            shareholders, mergers and acquisitions of banks with fewer of them remaining on the market. According to
            various estimates, the number of banks may drop to 10-12 from the current 21. According to forecasts, the
            growth of the banking system of Armenia in 2015-2017 will not go beyond 10-15%. While the interest rates on
            local currency-denominated funds are expected to go up, the rates on the funds in foreign currency are

        <p>One of the key strategic objectives over the recent years has been further strengthening of the Bank’s
            position in the Armenian retail banking through continual and dynamic growth. Our relentless efforts in
            terms of developing targeted retail banking solutions with individualised service and changing customers’
            perception of Ameriabank’s traditionally “corporate bank” image, have yielded significant results. Despite
            slow economic growth and market challenges at the end of 2014, Bank has improved its position in main
            indicators and become one of the Retail business market leaders.</p>

        <p><span>New Products and Propositions</span><br>For several years now, in line with exercising individual
            approach to each customer, the Bank has also adhered to the principle of identifying and addressing the
            needs of specific target segments. After successfully launching Ameria Partner and Ameria Premium packages
            for high profile customer base in 2013, the Bank initiated development and launch of the third product and
            service package to meet mid-segment clients’ needs. Ameria Persona package is designed for active users of
            banking services who are in need of timesaving solutions. This “smart” package includes all key banking
            products that clients may require and enables them to get benefit of preferential rates and terms while
            banking with Ameriabank. Apart from the key banking services, Ameria Persona clients have a dedicated
            personal manager who provides them with customised solutions to their issues. They have a chance to arrange
            a meeting in advance and manage their time to the best of their convenience. In 2014 the first stage of
            Customer Loyalty Programme was launched enabling cardholders to gain rewards from card transactions. These
            rewards can be exchanged to banking services with preferential rates. The Bank also provides reward points
            for such “events” as referrals, customer loyalty (number of the banking years with Ameriabank), holidays,
            birthdays, etc. Customers may obtain different banking products with 100% discount. Loyalty programme is
            available for cobranded cards as well. This provides co-branded card holders with great opportunity of using
            accumulated points to enhance relationship with the Bank (open free accounts, cards and become a distance
            banking user). During the second stage we plan to activate cobranded card loyalty programme by developing
            different ways of utilizing the accumulated points.</p>

        <p><span>Multichannel Distribution Network</span><br>The Bank actively develops multichannel distribution
            network. Providing full package distance banking channels to our customers will become one of the Bank’s
            main priorities in 2015. A series of complex projects have been initiated to empower the Bank’s multichannel
            distribution network and transactional banking component. Mobile banking and phone banking have been in the
            pipeline of development projects for few years now and will be fully effective in year 2015. Also, in 2014,
            distance channel development project, ATM and branch network expansion projects were implemented.<br>In the
            frame of distance channel development project the Bank has improved Online Banking service facilities for
            customers and defined special tariffs and conditions for transactions made with Online Banking.<br>In March
            2014, Ameriabank opened new Arshakunyats branch in Yerevan, located in a large shopping mall. This was our
            first branch that offered extended banking hours to customers. The branch works from 10:00AM to 10:00PM 7
            days a week to ensure utmost banking convenience. Moreover, the premises of the new branch host self-service
            Express Banking equipment. The convenient location, spacious premises, cutting-edge facilities and
            professionalism of the staff ensure high standard of service and satisfaction of our customers. In 2015, the
            Bank opened another branch in Kapan (Syunik marz).<br>Ameriabank has 103 ATMs installed across Armenia. ATM
            network expansion is not the only key point in service quality and convenience improvement. We have upgraded
            ATMs service by installing ATMs with cash-in possibility and are planning to install cash-in terminals in
            2015.</p>

        <p><span>Customer base and Deposits</span><br>
            Being committed to our strategy of providing high quality customer service and wide range of banking
            products with flexible and attractive terms, the Bank offers targeted service and product solutions to each
            customer segment. This allows improving customer satisfaction and loyalty. As a result, Ameriabank’s retail individual customer base has increased by 23%. Premium/Partner customer base has increased approximately by 25%.
            Increase of customer base was accompanied by noticeable increase of the deposit customer base, ensuring 38%
            growth of time deposit base by Ameria Partner and Premium customers. The total demand and time deposits from
            Individuals have grown from AMD 82.3 bln to AMD 103.5 bln (25.7% YoY growth).</p>

        <p><span>Salary projects</span><br> Due to optimization of salary project related processes we have minimized the time span of negotiations and
            organization of the project opening. At the same time we increased the range of products and solutions
            provided to payroll customers and improved the convenience factors of the salary projects. As a result, we
            expanded our list of new partner companies. The Bank had 33.4% increase in the number of salary project
            member customers and 22% increase in the number of companies cooperating with it in terms of payroll
        accounts.</p>

            the “Boomerang” campaign a great opportunity was given to those SME borrowers, who were transferring their
            loans to Ameriabank from other banks. One of main advantages of the offer was 1% pay-back of the loan amount
            to the borrower. Later on, “Boomerang” campaign was applied for mortgage loans as well. As it comes to loans
            for individuals, the mortgage loans had a share of 33% in the total individual retail lending portfolio of
            the Bank. The volumes of the mortgage portfolio increased by 67.3%, up to AMD 16,931 mln. The Bank offers
            car loans for purchase of cars from both primary and secondary markets. We cooperate with all the leading

            on an array of topics, such as debt and equity funding from non-public capital markets, structured finance

        </p>

        <p>During FY14 CF team successfully concluded a convertible subordinated debt facility with FMO, which will
            eventually “park” a triple-A rated shareholder in the bank’s capital structure. The transaction was
            unprecedented for the banking sector of Armenia and is an important building block of Ameriabank’s mid-term
            capitalisation plan. Senior debt facilities at the aggregate amount of USD 20 mln were signed in 2014, while
            additional USD 90 mln is in the pipeline subject to further negotiations.</p>

        <p>Throughout the previous 5 years, the cumulative volume of funds attracted from international/development
            financial institutions reached USD 300 mln, including funds raised from the International Finance
            Corporation (IFC), Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO), German Investment and Development Company
            (DEG), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Eurasian Development Bank (EDB), Asian
            Development Bank (ADB), Development Bank of Austria (OeEB), PROPARCO and the Black Sea Trade and Development
            Bank (BSTDB). The bank initiated negotiations with OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) in Q4,
            2014 and it is expected that a senior debt facility will be concluded not later than the second half of 2015. The funds raised from IFIs and DFIs were streamed towards on-lending to SMEs, Energy
            Efficiency/Renewable Energy and Agribusiness projects. Thus, Ameriabank has reiterated its focus on
            supporting SMEs and enhancing the scale of EE/RE and Agribusiness projects deployment in Armenia. We believe
            that streaming international investments into those segments is our important contribution to the
            sustainable growth of the country’s economy. The list of investors attracted by our CF team is not limited
            to IFIs/DFIs only. Major multinationals are among the Bank’s funding and transactional banking partners as
            well. On a private client advisory side, we were retained by one of the largest greenhouse operators in
            Armenia to advise them in structuring and raising USD 50 mln long-term funds for a large scale expansion
            project - planned to be finalised in YE2015.</p>

        <h1 class="strongTitle">Capital Markets</h1>

        <p>As a leader in local capital markets, Ameriabank is the only bank in Armenia that has a dedicated and
            experienced capital markets team and offers full range of services to debt and equity issuers, including
            corporate bond originations, IPOs/SPOs, market making services and IPO advisory. We are glad to reconfirm
            our leading role in the corporate bond market by acting as a joint lead manager and market maker for the
            first ever local currency bonds of International Finance Corporation (IFC) and European Bank for
            Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). IFC and EBRD AMD-denominated bonds were unique DCM projects by being
            the first ever non-resident and AAA-rated LCY bond originations. EBRD notes were also the first ever
            floaters introduced to local banks and other financial institutions as a new tool for liquidity management.
            All these issues got listed on Nasdaq OMX Armenia stock exchange and thanks to Ameriabank’s market making
            have been actively traded in the secondary market since then. Ameriabank was the most active market maker on
            NASDAQ OMX Armenia stock exchange, providing services for IFC 3-year AMD notes, EBRD’s 1-year AMD notes,
            local SHEN HOLDING’s 5-year USD notes and SAS GROUP’s 2-year USD notes in 2014. Moreover, due to market
            making services of Ameriabank, SAS GROUP’s 2-year USD notes became the most actively traded corporate
            securities in the history of Nasdaq OMX Armenia, with total turnover of c. USD 6.8 mln or 96% and number of
            deals exceeding 100 as of December 2014 when the notes matured.</p>

        <p>Ameriabank still advocates for capital market development in Armenia and in the region, believing in and
            contributing to the promising future of both local equity and debt securities markets.</p>

        <h1 class="strongTitle">Mergers & Acquisitions</h1>

        <p>Our M&A team provides full range of services, related to sale, acquisition/ merger of companies. We
            specialize in valuation of businesses, financial and commercial due diligence, standby advisory and
            management of sale/ acquisition projects. We take advantage of unique market knowledge and networking with
            the business community in Armenia and abroad based on over 15 years of operations of Ameria Group. In 2014,
            we consulted our clients in various sectors, including HORECA, financial services, mining, specialty retail,
            petroleum trade and food processing. The Bank constantly studies the economy and works with major market
            players in various sectors to identify M&A opportunities. In 2014 Armenia joined the Eurasian Economic Union
            (EEU) and is, in the meantime, working towards strengthening political and economic ties with the EU. It is
            continuing to develop and is expected to have above average
            growth rates in the midterm.</p>

        <p>We believe this would help to bridge Armenia to EEU and EU countries, which would create more opportunities
            for M&As and cross-border transactions between those countries. Therefore, our focus for the coming year
            would be on serving the domestic and cross-border M&A deals in Armenia.</p>

        <h1 class="strongTitle">CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT</h1>

        <p>Dear Colleagues,<br>Ameriabank vigorously adheres to high standards of corporate governance. Our Board is
            committed to contributing to the continual improvement and application of corporate governance processes
            that are aimed at ensuring transparent and accountable environment for all our stakeholders.</p>

        <p>These processes are supported by the right culture and values throughout the Bank, based on openness,
            transparency and accountability, as well as constructive challenge and collaboration. Our Board plays a
            particularly important role by setting the tone at the top. Our CEO and other key executives are responsible
            for outspreading this culture through the company. Effective corporate governance is an important foundation
            for Ameriabank’s strong performance and is fundamental to our success. Corporate governance provides proper
            oversight and accountability, strengthens internal and external relationships, builds trust with our
            stakeholders and promotes the long-term interests of shareholders. Here are a few of the core ideas that
            support our Board and governance philosophies:</p>

        <p> Our Chairman and CEO positions are separate and cannot be filled by a single person.
            Our senior executives have their role in the Bank as the main focal point of their professional development,
            thus eliminating any possibility of potential conflicts of interest.</p>

        <p>We build upon a diverse Board both in terms of experience, geographic origin and gender.
            Board succession planning is another fundamental component ensuring the Bank’s sustainability and therefore,
            it is actively managed, also through regular performance reviews.</p>

        <p>We have earned the trust of our partners and customers as they believe that Ameria Group provides mitigated
            risk environment and the Board takes rigorous control over the risk management and execution of internal
            processes. To increase the efficiency of the Board and comply with the latest trends of corporate governance
            practices internationally, in 2014 the Bank embarked on an extensive process of refining Board management
            regulations and creating even more transparent environment for our local and international shareholders.</p>

        <p>We firmly believe our Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate governance and will continue
            to develop its skills and capabilities to promote the long-term success of the Group, over the course of
            2015 and beyond.</p>

        <p>In line with semi-annual KPI (key performance indicator) based evaluation for every single team member, we
            also apply 360-degree assessment method on annual basis. This method helps identify true leaders and hence
            promote excellence. 360-degree feedback is a method of systematically collecting opinions about an
            individual’s performance from a wide range of coworkers. This could include peers, subordinates, direct
            supervisor and top management. The benefit of collecting data of this kind is that the person gets to see a
            panorama of perceptions rather than just self-perception, which affords a more complete picture. As part of
            our leadership development focus, in 2014 we organised a special Leadership Master Class for Staff and
            Partners by inviting one of the most prominent leadership experts in the world to Armenia. Professor Manfred
            F. R. Kets de Vries, President of prominent KDVI leadership consulting firm, professor at of INSEAD’s Global
            Leadership Center, one of the largest leadership development centers in the world gave a master class on
            Leadership Challenges for the Group mid-managers and top executives. Apart from midmanagers and top
            executives the list of master class participants included also clients and partners of America Group, in
            particular, representatives of government institutions, as well as local and international organisations.
            Two-day training presented vision of high performance teams, corporate culture peculiarities and change
            management.

        <p>

        <p>The sole purpose of the second day of training was to improve leadership skills of Ameria Group’s management
            with focus on efficient motivational instruments and constructive changes within organisation. Ameria Group
            lays special emphasis on effective management skills and highly qualified team, with particular attention
            given to professional and personal development of its staff. Therefore, similar master classes are organised
            every year. Previously, a series of leadership seminars and talks were held jointly with Skolkovo Moscow
            School of Management, featuring such prominent speakers as Pierre Casse, Professor of Management at the
            Kellogg School of Management, Dean Emeritus of the Berlin School of Creative Leadership; Elizabeth Sadova,
            Academic Director of Executive Education Programme at Skolkovo Moscow School of Management, and others. It
            is notable that Board Members of the Bank, who have extensive international experience also regularly share
            their vision of leadership and management issues with the staff. Thus, leadership talks were held by Ruben
            Vardanyan, Founding Partner of Skolkovo Moscow School of Management and Vice- Chairman of its International
            Advisory Board; Noubar Afeyan, Senior Lecturer on entrepreneurship at MIT’s Sloan School of Management; Gor
